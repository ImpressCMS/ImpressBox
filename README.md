# What is this?

This is a template for [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and it used for developing websites based on [ImpressCMS](https://www.impresscms.org).

# How to use it?

At the first you need to have installed [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and git on your system. Then you can execute these steps from command line:
